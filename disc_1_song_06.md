Hey bungalow bill
what did you kill
bungalow bill

when out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
in case of accidents he always took his mum
who's the only *inaudible* bullet headed sex and mothers song

all the children sing

Hey bungalow bill
what did you kill
bungalow bill

Hey bungalow bill
what did you kill
bungalow bill

deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lie
bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
shoot *inaudible* marbles at them right between the eyes

all the children sing

Hey bungalow bill
what did you kill
bungalow bill

Hey bungalow bill
what did you kill
bungalow bill

the children asked them if to kill was not a sin
that when he looked so fierce his mommy battered him
if love could kill it would have been us instead of him

all the children sing

Hey bungalow bill
what did you kill
bungalow bill

Hey bungalow bill
what did you kill
